# OMF-Samples

The OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) defines a set of message headers and bodies that can be used to generate compliant messages for ingestion into an on-premises PI System or OSIsoft Cloud Services.

These OMF samples are introductory, language-specific examples demonstrating how to generate OMF messages and send them to a compatible endpoint. They are intended as instructional samples only.

More information on OMF can be found [here.](http://omf-docs.osisoft.com)

The samples are divided in two sub-groups:  
- Tutorials â€“ These samples are platform and programming language agnostic, and show common OMF version 1.0 functionality.
- Community Samples. These samples are provided to us by you - our growing community of developers interested in OSIsoft Messaging Format data ingress technologies. Thank you for your interest and contributions!
