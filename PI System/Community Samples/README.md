The files in this repository illustrate a single programming example that has been ported to many of the most useful languages and platforms requested by OSIsoft customers. The examples clearly illustrate how to send data using the OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) from both Windows and Linux platforms, using either x86 and ARM processors. Feel free to let us know if you are interested in seeing these examples ported to other languages or hardware platforms.
